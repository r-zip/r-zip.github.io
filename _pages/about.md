I am a third-year PhD student in computer science at Johns Hopkins University. My research focuses on explaining machine learning models using sparse approximation and information theory.

In the past, I obtained BS and MS degrees in biomedical and electrical engineering, respectively, from North Carolina State University. Prior to starting the PhD, I worked as a data scientist at [Infinia ML](https://infiniaml.com).
